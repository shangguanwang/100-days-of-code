# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

### Day 1: Jun 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Scrimba Advanced React Router Lesson 1-12, created the routers for Van Life App.

**Thoughts:** React handles complex multi-page application, therefore the framework itself is also complex. I hope you can follow along this course.

### Day 2: July 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: reviewed React's compound component with children

**Thoughts**: Don't be scared by new concepts. It will become second nature one day.

### Day 3: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
